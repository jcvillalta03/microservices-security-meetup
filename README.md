# Microservices Security Meetup Demo Project

This is a Gradle multi-project repository that contains 2 services:

1. Token service (Micronaut, located in `/token-service`)
2. Airline service (Spring Boot, located in `/airline-service`)

Using these two services, one can demo using JWTs for authentication, and using the JWT claims for authorization.
